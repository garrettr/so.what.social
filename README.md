This is a public feed aggregator. 
Thanks to Twitter, things are a little more complicated.

Supported platforms:

1.  Facebook Pages
    Provide the link to a Page's RSS feed. You can find this by
    a) logging into Facebook
    b) go to the page - in the left column, choose "Subscribe via RSS" and copy the resulting URL.
2.  RSS/Atom feeds
    Provide the link to the feed.
3.  Twitter
    Just provide the Twitter screenname. We use Twitter's REST API instead of YQL due to Twitter's [recent discontinuation of RSS].
